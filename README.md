# tenminmailgen
Generates 10minutemail adresses and watches for incoming mails
  
## What does it do?
Generates mail adresses from 10minutemail.com (within their flood protection limits) and watches them, if you want to, for new mails  
Can be used as module (which it was written for) or from command line, python 3 or higher

## Why?  
Create trash mails from command-line - what could be cooler?  
Feel free to criticize, since it was written in a short time it doesn't contain much.
